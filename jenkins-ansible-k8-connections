generate ssh-keygen on jenkins server into /var/lib/jenkins
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Enter file in which to save the key (root/.ssh/id_rsa):  /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa
ENTER
ENTER
this command will generate two keys - id_rsa(Private key) - I will create an admin(any name) user on MANAGE CREDENTIALS in Jenkins and copy this private key.
                                      id_rsa.pub(Public Key)
                                      
Private key can be used on Jenkins GUI as a credentials.


If I want to connect my Jenkins server with Ansible server and Kubernetes master - I need to copy the public key(var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa) of jenkins server onto the 
ansible server and Kubernetes server -

  1. Go to Ansible server and create an admin user in order to authentication and running playbooks here-
  2. adduser admin
  3. cd /home/admin
  4. create .ssh directory using mkdir .ssh
  5. cd .ssh
  6. vi authorized_keys -> paste the "id_rsa.pub" content fron "jenkins"(refer line number 12) to here.
  7. chmod 600 authorized_keys
  8. give the sudo permission to this "admin" user to get the root privileges
  9. visudo -> root    ALL=(ALL)     ALL
               admin   ALL=(ALL)     ALL 
               save :wq
               
  Perform the similar steps from line number 15 till line number 25) on kubernetes server as well.
